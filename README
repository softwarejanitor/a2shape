a2shape

Compile an Apple II shape table.


Input file format is as follows:

Each line is a shape.

Each line consists of plot/move commands as follows:

u = no-plot up
r = no-plot right
d = no-plot down
l = no-plot left
U = plot up
R = plot right
D = plot down
L = plot left


Example:

LLLLLDDDDDRRRRRUUUUUllldddD
RRRRRDDDDDLLLLLUUUUUrrrdddD

That produces two shapes.
Each shape is a box with a dot in the middle.
The first is drawn counter clockwise, the second clockwise.


Usage can be gotten by -h.


Usage: a2shape.pl [-h] [-a] [-b] [-d] in_file out_file

 -h  Print this usage
 -a  Output shape table in Applesoft BASIC format
 -b  Output shape table in binary format for BLOADing
 -v  Turn on verbose
 -d  Turn on debug
